- ***Gradle Version: 7.5***
- ***Kotlin Version: 1.8.10***

## Build with :art:
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose">Jetpack Compose</a> : Jetpack Compose is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel">View Model</a> : The ViewModel class is a business logic or screen level state holder. It exposes state to the UI and encapsulates related business logic. Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes. This means that your UI doesn’t have to fetch data again when navigating between activities, or following configuration changes, such as when rotating the screen.
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room">Room</a> : The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- <a href="https://m3.material.io/">Material3</a> : The Material 3 Design Kit is built to work with the Material Theme Builder Figma plugin. Select an image or color to visualize dynamic color in your UI.
- <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html">Coroutines</a> : A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and are based on established concepts from other languages.
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow">Flow</a> : Flow is the Kotlin type that can be used to model streams of data. Just like LiveData and RxJava streams, Flow lets you implement the observer pattern: a software design pattern that consists of an object (a.k.a. observable, producer, source, emitter) that maintains a list of its dependents, called observers (subscribers, collectors, receivers, etc.), and notifies them automatically of any state changes. 
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android">Daggar Hilt</a> : Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. Doing manual dependency injection requires you to construct every class and its dependencies by hand, and to use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation">Navigating with Compose</a> : The Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications. You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation component’s infrastructure and features.
- <a href="http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/android-compose">Lottie</a> : Lottie is a library for Android, iOS, Web, and Windows that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile and on the web!
- <a href="https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/">Coil</a> : An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- <a href="https://github.com/google/accompanist">Accompanist</a> : Accompanist is a group of libraries that aim to supplement Jetpack Compose with features that are commonly required by developers but not yet available.
